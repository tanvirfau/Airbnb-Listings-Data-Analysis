# Airbnb Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook from Google Colab that performs data analysis on Airbnb listings. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insights based on business decisions.

## Project Overview

In this project, I aim to explore the relationship between various factors like `listing price`, `room types`, `neighborhood distribution`, and `reviews over time`. The data analyzed comes from Airbnb listings, and the primary goal is to extract actionable insights that can inform business decisions.

### Key Questions Explored:
1. **What is the distribution of listing prices?**
2. **How are different room types distributed?**
3. **How are listings distributed across different neighborhoods?**
4. **What is the relationship between price and room type?**
5. **How has the number of reviews changed over time?**

### Additional Insights:
- Analyzed correlation between the number of reviews and price.
- Provided recommendations based on pricing and review patterns for improving business strategy.

## Requirements

The notebook requires the following Python libraries:

- `pandas` - For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib` - For creating plots and visualizations.
- `seaborn` - For statistical data visualization.
- `numpy` - For numerical computations.

Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
